I took a look at django-session-security code and it completely relies on 
django.contrib.auth code for redirection after login. I kept "diving" into 
django.contrib.auth source code and I found out that the problem is that only 
url "safety" is checked for permitting url redirection after successful login. 
Therefore, I am pretty sure that a possible solution will be to include there a 
check like:

    if past_user != current_user:
        redirect_url = # successful url after login in accordance with SETTINGS

########## METHOD 1:
# This method (@django.contrib.auth.views) is discarded since "request.session"
is set to the current logged user and not the previous one:

    if SESSION_KEY in request.session:
        logger.debug(">>>> " + __name__ + ", SESSION_KEY")
        if request.session[SESSION_KEY] != request.user.pk:
            logger.debug(">>>> " + __name__ + ", user.pk !=")
            redirect_to = resolve_url(settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL)
