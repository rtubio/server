			<p>
The SatNet Network is a project that aims at developing reusable software to
enable sharing the existing Ground Station facilities for commanding CubeSats.
To achieve this, the SatNet Network provides a network infrastructure that
allows CubeSat operators to access remote Ground Stations; as well as the
basic software for connecting the Ground Stations and the Mission control
centers to the network servers.

				This project started on 2014 as part of a post-doctoral
				research conducted at the California Polytechnic State
				University under a Fundación Barrié scholarship. The University
				of Vigo (Spain) and the INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas
				Espaciais, Brasil) joined the team later.
