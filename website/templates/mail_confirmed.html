<h1>Successful Mail Confirmation</h1>

<p>
You have just succesfully confirmed your email in the system.
</p>

<p>
	However, your account still needs to be accepted by the operator of the
    network. This is a process that should normally take no more than 2 to 3
    days. In case you do not receive a reply from the administration of this
    server, try to reach us through a ticket at our GitHub's project:
