<h2>Overview</h2>


<p>The <b>SATNet</b> network is a software development project hosted at
<a class='link' href="https://github.com/satnet-project/satnet-main/wiki">
GitHub</a>. Its objective is to develop the software for the nodes of a 
communications network that shares Ground Stations among CubeSat operators.</p>

<p>A simplified description for the network topology is provided in the figure
on the right. The SATNet network is intended to be composed of several
independent <b>subnetworks</b> that can be interconnected, either for sharing
resources or for redundancy.</p>

<p>The <b>server nodes</b> are the core for each subnetwork, enabling the 
sharing of the resources of its <b>client nodes</b> across other subnetworks. 
Ground Station owners will define their availablity and sharing rules, so that 
restrictions may apply when connecting those facilities to Spacecraft Operations 
Centres. Subnetworks may be private if so defined, restricting the share of 
resources only in between its members.</p>

<p>The complete description of the system can be found in the wiki site enabled
at <a class='link' href="https://github.com/satnet-project/satnet-main/wiki">
