<h1>Staff's Home</h1>

<p>
This is the home for the <i>staff</i> users; i.e., for those users with 
privileges for managing the main resources of the network. Sections below 
contain a brief description of the tools available for performing the 
<b>regular maintenance operations</b> that the network, in accordance with its
design, may require. In case any kind of problem appears that was not taken 
into account in the original design, a set of external tools is provided for
performing <b>exceptional maintenance operations</b> on the system.
</p>

<h2>Regular Maintenance Operations</h2>

<h3>User Management Operations</h3>

<p>
These operations permit the management of user accounts in accordance to their
lifecycle. This lifecycle is graphically defined in the figure on the right, in
which a given user account passes through the different states that are 
permitted within this system.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>Users are initially <b>unregistered</b>.</li>
    <li>For accessing the system, they need to create an account in the system. 
        This account creation will appear as a <b>pending</b> to any 
        staff user.</li>
    <li>Staff users can <b>verify</b> this pending account, so that the system
        will automatically send an email to the user for verifing that email
        address and will mark the account as <b>inactive</b> .</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In case the information provided by users cannot be trusted, staff
            users can <b>delete</b> that request.</li>
        <li>If the request is repeated several times with the same email 
            address, staff users can <b>block</b> that email address so that
            subsequent requests will not appear as pending again.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once users receive the confirmation email, they can click on the link 
        that is provided for verifying that they own their email address. In 
        case the verification was correct, user account changes its state to
        <b>verified</b>, enabling users access to the system.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The link provided expires after 4 days. If it was not used, the 
            still existing but <i>inactive</i> account will be deleted by 
            the system maintenance periodic task.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Verified users can be either blocked or deleted, as required.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Exceptional Maintenance Operations</h2>

<p>Since <i>exception</i> operations, by definitions, cannot be defined 
beforehand, this section simply presents the set of tools available for dealing 
with these issues.

These tools can only be accessed within the same network of the server node.

<ul>
    <li>
        <a class='link' href="http://localhost:8000/admin">Django Admin</a>
        , an external Django application manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class='link' href="localhost/phpmyadmin">PhpMy Admin</a>
        , an external database management.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
